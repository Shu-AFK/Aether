# Aether Kernel

Aether is a simple 32-bit kernel developed from scratch as a personal learning experience in understanding the fundamentals of operating system design and development. 
The project aims to explore core concepts such as system architecture, process management, and memory handling at the kernel level.

## Project Overview

Building Aether is all about learning and growing. Every piece of it was put together with the goal of really getting to grips with how operating systems work. 
It's a hands-on way to peek under the hood and understand what makes them run.

## Getting Started

This section guides you through setting up a local development environment to build and run the Aether kernel.

### Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shu-AFK/Aether.git
cd Aether
```

### Install prerequisites

to install all prerequisites, make sure to run the dependency script(`install-dependencies.sh`)
```bash
chmod +x install-dependencies.sh
./install-dependencies.sh
```
### Building the Kernel and running it

```bash
chmod +x build-and-test.sh
./build-and-test.sh
```
